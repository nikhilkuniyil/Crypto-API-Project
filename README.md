# Automated-Crypto-API-Project

## Overview<br/>
• Utilized the CoinMarketCap API to pull data (price trajectory over time, last price, etc.) about various Cryptocurrency coins (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano etc.)
• Utilized the Python Pandas library to parse the data and transform the API's data into a Pandas Dataframe

## Programming Languages / Libraries
• Python
• Pandas
• Seaborn

## File Descriptions

### **'API.csv'**<br/>
